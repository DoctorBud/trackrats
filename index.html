          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>

          <h4>What is Car-a-oke?</h4>
          <p>
A bunch of friends get together in a safe, outdoor place and sing songs. Usually we sing karaoke tracks, but sometimes we sing <em>a capella</em>, and sometimes we sing along with the original singer on a non-karaoke track.
          </p>

          <h4>How did it start?</h4>
          <p>
We began this in the early days of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The bars that we would ordinarily sing Karaoke at had been shut down for months, and we decided to get together in a safe way, practicing respect and social distancing.
          </p>
          <p>
The original incarnation of car-a-oke began on May 2, 2020 with this modest text message sent to a few friends:
<blockquote>
I'm trying to piece together "car-eoke" for a small group using my car's Bluetooth stereo system.  I could put 6 or so people in for a session, taking turns playing YouTube karaoke videos on your phone through my speakers, no contact required.  Maybe a parking lot later this week?  Anyone got other ideas?
</blockquote>
          </p>

          <h4>Why bother writing this FAQ?</h4>
          <p>
We discovered, after some minor drama, that it made sense to summarize what we've learned so far so that when we invite new guests into our circle, there are shared expectations and fewer unpleasant surprises.
          </p>

          <h4>What to expect</h4>
          <p>
            Typically we've been gathering around sundown in remote outdoor parking lot with beautiful views and not many neighbors around.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few of us bring cars which have Bluetooth stereo systems, and some of us bring portable battery-powered speakers that we can also use.
          </p>
          <p>
            We sing, we talk, we laugh, we drink. Lather, rinse, repeat.
          </p>


          <h4>What to bring?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A positive, respectful attitude.
            </li>
            <li>
              Substances that help you relax and enjoy your time with friends and karaoke. Please try to be aware that glass bottles or glasses have a higher risk of breaking and causing a mess in whatever venue we are at.
            </li>
          </ul>


          <h4>Preparing your song list</h4>
          <p>
            YouTube playlists are a nice start.
          </p>


          <h4>Are there any Rules?</h4>
          <p>
            So far, the only rule we've needed to insist on is: TYBO (Turn your Bluetooth Off). Because we are often relying upon Bluetooth speakers and we are often changing singers, it is important for non-singing folks to keep their Bluetooth off on their smartphone (if any). This makes it way easier for the next singer to get set up and singing.
