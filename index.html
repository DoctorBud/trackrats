          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>

          <h4>What is Car-a-oke?</h4>
          <p>
A bunch of friends get together in a safe, outdoor place and sing songs. Usually we sing karaoke tracks, but sometimes we sing <em>a capella</em>, and sometimes we sing along with the original singer on a non-karaoke track.
          </p>

          <h4>How did it start?</h4>
          <p>
We began this in the early days of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The bars that we would ordinarily sing Karaoke at had been shut down for months, and we decided to get together in a safe way, practicing respect and social distancing.
          </p>
          <p>
The original incarnation of car-a-oke began on May 2, 2020 with this modest text message sent to a few friends:
<blockquote>
I'm trying to piece together "car-eoke" for a small group using my car's Bluetooth stereo system.  I could put 6 or so people in for a session, taking turns playing YouTube karaoke videos on your phone through my speakers, no contact required.  Maybe a parking lot later this week?  Anyone got other ideas?
</blockquote>
          </p>

          <h4>Why bother writing this FAQ?</h4>
          <p>
We discovered, after a misunderstanding, that it made sense to summarize what we've learned so far so that when we invite new guests into our circle, there are shared expectations and fewer unpleasant surprises.
          </p>

          <h4>What to expect</h4>
          <p>
            Typically we've been gathering around sundown in remote outdoor parking lot with beautiful views and not many neighbors around.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few of us bring cars which have Bluetooth stereo systems, and some of us bring portable battery-powered speakers that we can also use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because many of us are older or have family that are at higher risk of serious illness or death from diseases like Covid-19, we practice <b>safe-distancing</b>, which usually means we are at least several feet apart from each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also means that when we move around through our group, we are mindful of keeping that distance, even if it means walking around to avoid folks. Many of us would not be able to join this event responsibly and safely if we could not count on folks to be aware and considerate.
          </p>
          <p>
            We keep it cool and try to not be noticeable or provocative to neighbors, security guards, or police. The party will end quickly if we are in jail.
          </p>
          <p>
            We sing, we talk, we laugh, we drink. Lather, rinse, repeat.
          </p>


          <h4>What to bring?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A smartphone is not essential, but it is what most of us have been using to play our karaoke songs through the Bluetooth, and to read our lyrics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Beverages or other substances that help you relax and enjoy your time with friends and karaoke. Be responsible and aware of the law and the risk and BYOB.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are a cigarette smoker, bring your own; don't expect to be able to buy or bum them or find a store.
            </li>
            <li>
              An extra layer of clothing or a blanket, since it gets colder after sunset
            </li>
            <li>
              Something to sit on, which might be a camp chair, or a blanket or rug. Often we may be on pavement which may have glass, so be careful.
            </li>
            <li>
              A facemask is not required, but if it makes you feel more comfortable, go for it.
            </li>
            <li>
              A patient, respectful attitude. This is an experiment we are all in together.
            </li>
            <li>
              A list of songs you might sing, usually a playlist on your phone (see below)
            </li>
          </ul>


          <h4>Preparing your song list</h4>
          <p>
            YouTube playlists are a nice start.
          </p>


          <h4>Are there any Rules?</h4>
          <p>
            So far, the only rules we've needed to insist on are:
          </p>
          <div class="itembox">
            <h5>TYBO (Turn your Bluetooth Off)</h5>
            <p>
              Because we are often relying upon Bluetooth speakers and we are often changing singers, it is important for non-singing folks to keep their Bluetooth off on their smartphone (if any). This makes it way easier for the next singer to get set up and singing.
            </p>

            <h5>Keep your distance</h5>
            <p>
              Everyone has different personal assessments of their own risk of catching the disease-of-the-year (Covid-19, in this case). This group got together because we want to be with friends and sing, but we also want to minimize the health risk to ourselves and our families or people we work with. So we use science, common sense, and mutual respect to balance these issues.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h4>When do these events happen?</h4>
          <p>
            We are still figuring that out. But Thursday evenings have been pretty reliable so far, and we've also had a couple good weekend sessions, which is convenient if you have to work on Friday morning. One proposal is to try to settle on Thursday/Saturday as a default (the old TBL schedule). But many factors (e.g., weather, curfew) may result in an event being cancelled, or at least not well-attended. In other cases, we'll see an opportunity for an event due to a friend visiting our town or a holiday weekend.
          </p>

          <h4>How to I find out more and stay in touch?</h4>
          <p>
            There is a Facebook group ... TBD
          </p>
          <p>
            We are figuring out a way to enable folks who aren't on Facebook to be alerted about changes to plans.
